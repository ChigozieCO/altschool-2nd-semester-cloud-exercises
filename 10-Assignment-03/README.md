# Task

Remember that task where you deployed an open source app on GitHub using Apache?

You would be deploying same but this time around using ansible.

Your ansible slave will consist of one ubuntu node and one centos(rhel) node.

Your master node can be of any Linux distribution of your choice(3 nodes in all).

Explore using variables in ansible while executing this task.

# Instruction

You will push your playbooks to your GitHub account and submit a link to same 

Then we will discuss in class(probably next week Saturday)

And submission deadline would be on or before 6pm next Saturday 

# Solution

My ansible playbook is found [here](./ansible/playbook/serverplay.yml)

A walkthrough of my process is published [her](https://dev.to/chigozieco/install-apache-web-server-and-serve-a-custom-webpage-using-ansible-3n73) take a look at it.
